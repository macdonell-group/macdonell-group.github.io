      <h3>Ryan MacDonell</h3>
      <p><b>Assistant Professor</b></p>
      <p><b>Department of Chemistry, Department of Physics and Atmospheric Science</b></p>

      <p>
      Ryan received his B.Sc. Honours Chemistry from Carleton University in 2014.
      He moved down the Rideau Canal to work on his Ph.D. at the
      University of Ottawa with Michael Schuurman (National Research
      Council Canada), which he completed in early 2020. He then moved to Sydney,
      Australia, to work as a postdoctoral research associate with Prof. Ivan Kassal at
      the University of Sydney, before returning to his home province of Nova
      Scotia in 2023 to work as an assistant professor at Dalhousie.

      <h3>Jongkwon Ha</h3>
      <p><b>Postdoctoral Fellow</b></p>

      <p>
      Jongkwon completed his B.Sc. at Ulsan National Institute of Technology
      (UNIST) in South Korea in 2016. He then stayed at UNIST to pursue a Ph.D. with
      Prof. Seung Kyu Min on nonadiabatic dynamics based on exact factorization
      and machine learning. He completed his Ph.D. in 2022 and stayed briefly
      at UNIST as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2023, he joined the MacDonell
      Group to work on developing analog quantum simulation techniques for photochemical
      dynamics.
