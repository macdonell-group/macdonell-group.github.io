Our goal is to study and better understand what happens after a molecule
absorbs a photon, particularly where a molecule may then undergo internal
conversion between electronic states. A more complete picture of
photochemistry gives us the ability to predict reaction products and trends
in photochemical reactions, with potential applications in light harvesting,
molecular machines and organic synthesis.

### Photochemical reaction pathways and conical intersection seams
Molecular dynamics are governed by potential energy surfaces, which describe
the energies of electronic states of a molecule for all changes in the
positions of atomic nuclei. Two electronic states can meet at a conical
intersection seam, which acts like a funnel that takes a molecular wavefunction
between electronic states without emitting a photon. Much of photochemistry
involves "downhill" reactions from an excited electronic state back to the
ground state, meaning the molecular wavefunction has enough initial energy
to access many regions of the intersection seam. This is strong contrast with
the "uphill" picture used in transition state theory for thermal reactions,
and it requires a new interpretation to understand and predict photochemical
reaction outcomes.
