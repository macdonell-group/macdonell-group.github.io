## Shining a light on the fundamentals of photochemistry using classical and quantum computers

<font size="5">
Welcome to the MacDonell Group website! We are working towards gaining a better
understanding of photochemistry, internal conversion and nonadiabatic dynamics.
We develop new analysis tools to interpret photochemical reaction pathways, and
new platforms to accurately simulate reactions using quantum technologies.
